# Kivy-Android-Camera

## not working integration of TensorFlow  
# The app can be build with an instaltaion of [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [Biuldozer](https://buildozer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html)
With Builddozer you can now create an apk which you can run on your android device

## tibssys ReadMe 
Updated to work with kivy 2.2.0+
To run the app on your device don't forget to add permission to camera after installation. (No permission request is included in my code.)
To build I used Cython 0.29.36 and Buildozer 1.5.0
