# Kivy-Android-Camera

## now with not working integration of TensorFlow 
you still need to import an modell.py and a Tflite Model

## tibssys ReadMe 
Updated to work with kivy 2.2.0+
To run the app on your device don't forget to add permission to camera after installation. (No permission request is included in my code.)
To build I used Cython 0.29.36 and Buildozer 1.5.0
